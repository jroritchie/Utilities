How can you make it impossible to create an instance of Utilities? Why would you want to?

Just like Math, Utilities is a concept. It makes no sense to create a tangible Animal concept, but things like a dog, which are tangible,
can be derived from the concept of an animal. It makes sense to have a "dog" object, but not an "animal" object, because the word animal
is a concept. You can do this by making the Utilities constructor private.

Should you make any other constructors? Why - or why not?

No. (Will come back to this one)
